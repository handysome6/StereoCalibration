# prepare images (already done in this PC)
1. Create operation folder '0610_IMX477_infinity_still/' at the same level as 'calibrate_camera/'
2. Put calibration images in 'scenes/' under the operation folder. 
3. Put test images in 'test/' under the operation folder.

# calibrate step
4. Run 'python calibrate_camera/pairs_cut.py' to cut sbs images into two in THIS folder. 
5. Run 'python calibrate_camera/calibrate_vanilla.py' to calibrate in THIS folder.
    Tip: Filter out images by printing perViewError in calibrate_vanilla.py.
    Tip: Delete folder '0610_IMX477_infinity_still/calibration_data/' before re-calibrating.

# measure and test
7. Measure length step:
    run 'python measure_len/split_rectify_vanilla.py' to rectify test images.
    run 'python measure_len/measure_click.py' to measure length in a pair of images. 
        Tip: You can change which image to measure by modifying 'measure_click.py'
